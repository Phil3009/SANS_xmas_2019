Preamble: 

This callenge will require a fare amount of powershell. I have included all the commands run to help achieve the 
challenge plus given some context. If the command does not work or there is an error your on your own (;

Also note that the laser challenge may bug out and you will need to restart the terminal....its ok. You do not need to 
start all over to complete the challenge. But you will need to invoke all the WebRequests again as everything resets.

######################################      ANGLE       ############################################
First clue from calling card: 

>>> Get-Content /home/callingcard.txt

to find the first answer:

>>>Get-History 
 
 (Invoke-WebRequest http://127.0.0.1:1225/api/angle?val=65.5).RawContent

also: get the history using | Format-List to see the expanded property below:

I have many name=value variables that I share to applications system wide. At a command I 
will reveal my secrets once you Get my Child Items.

############################################    TEMPERATURE   ############################################

Second Clue: 

Navigate to /home/elf/depths.....and run:

>>> Get-ChildItem -File -recurse | Select-String -pattern "val=" | Select Path, Pattern, Filename

-temp =-33.5

I am one of many thousand similar txt's contained within the deepest of /home/elf/depths. 
Finding me will give you the most strength but doing so will require Piping all the FullNa
me's to Sort Length.



##########################################      GAS    ###################################################


Third Clue: This will involve you having to find the longest Fullname object (pathname+filename)


>>> Get-ChildItem -File -Path /home/elf/depths -Recurse | select-Object Fullname,@{Name=”NameLength”;Expression={$_.fullname.length}} | sort NameLength | Format-List

Now with the longest path you can copy and paste into a notepad or editor...BE SURE TO REMOVE ANY SPACES AND COMPACT TO ONE LINE

use below:

>>> Get-Content /home/elf/depths/larger/cloud/behavior/beauty/enemy/produce/age/chair/unknown/escape/vote/long/writer/behind/ahead/thin/occasionally/explore/tape/wherever/practical/therefore/cool/plate/ice/play/truth/potatoes/beauty/fourth/careful/dawn/adult/either/burn/end/accurate/rubbed/cake/main/she/threw/eager/trip/to/soon/think/fall/is/greatest/become/accident/labor/sail/dropped/fox/0jhj5xz6.txt


Get process information to include Username identification. Stop
 Process to show me you're skilled and in this order they must b
e killed:
bushy
alabaster
minty
holly
Do this for me and then you /shall/see .


To complete this do:

>>> Get-Process -IncludeUserName

>>> Stop-Process -Id [insert pid]      ****WARNING: The process Id number may change so run Get-process again to check***********

by doing this a directy will appear

>>>cd /shall/

>>>Get-Content ./see


Fourth Clue: 

Get the .xml children of /etc - an event log to be found. Group all .Id's and the last thi
ng will be in the Properties of the lonely unique event Id.

>>> Get-ChildItem /etc/ -Recurse -File -Name "*.xml"

Noting the above it is better to just copy and paste the whole file into an external editor. The below will land you in the
right direction but the answer is further down in the properties.

>>>Get-Content /etc/systemd/system/timers.target.wants/EventLog.xml | Select-String -Pattern ".Id" -SimpleMatch 

When you scroll down you will see the values for Gas...

do this to configure the laser.

>>>$correct_gases_postbody = "O=6&H=7&He=3&N=4&Ne=22&Ar=11&Xe=10&F=20&Kr=8&Rn=9"

>>>Invoke-WebRequest -Uri http://localhost:1225/api/gas -Method POST -Body $correct_gases_postbody

Fifth Clue: 

The last one is rather tricky...it is easy to miss and is included in the first clue.

>>>gci env:* | sort-object name | Format-List


Name  : riddle
Value : Squeezed and compressed I am hidden away. Expand me from my prison and I will 
        show you the way. Recurse through all /etc and Sort on my LastWriteTime to 
        reveal im the newest of all.


This is clue is misleading...Don't search for zip or tar files just Use this to get LastWriteTime

>>>gci -Recurse | sort LastWriteTime -Descending | select name, LastWriteTime, FullName | Format-List

The file is the first listed

>>>Expand-Archive /etc/apt/archive

...in your working directy goto: 

>>>cd ./archive/refraction

>>>Get-Content ./riddle

Very shallow am I in the depths of your elf home. You can find my entity by using my md5 i
dentity:
25520151A320B5B0D21561F92C8F6224

...also there is a runme.elf file do:

>>>chmod +x ./runme.elf

>>>./runme.elf

refraction?val=1.867

This will lead you back to the first clue....and you do not need to complete

>>> Get-ChildItem -File -Recurse | Get-FileHash -Algorithm MD5 | Where-Object{$_.Hash -eq "25520151A320B5B0D21561F92C8F6224"} | select FullName | Format-List

/home/elf/depths/produce/thhy5hll.txt
